# Today I Learned

On the second day of the GoStack Bootcamp (https://skylab.rocketseat.com.br/), we started learning
about the React.JS (https://pt-br.reactjs.org/) Framework.

- React.JS is used on UI implementations;
- It's a SPA (Single Page Application), which means that the page only loads once,
then everything is just rendered as the user moves through the page;
- It's completely implemented using JavaScript;

Some benefits of using ReactJS include:

- Organization: everything can be broken down to components;
- There's a clear division between Back-end and Front-end;
- You can use a single API for multiple clients;
- Uses declarative programming;
  - No need to check the previous state, you simply create a new state

We also saw some concepts behind Babel and Webpack, JSX, Props, States and Immutability.

Since the OmniStack week also used some React.JS, all the concepts saw today were already known.
But it was a nice opportunity to solidify theses concepts.
