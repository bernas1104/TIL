# Today I Learned

So, this week I started taking on some of the [Unity 3D Tutorial Projects](https://learn.unity.com/projects).
I thought about buy some GameDev online course, but as I talked to a friend about that, he told me to take a
shot at the learning section of the Unity 3D site.

I began with the [Creator Kit - RPG](https://learn.unity.com/project/creator-kit-rpg) project. It gives the basic
understand of the Unity 3D Windows, how to use some game assets/objects, design your own world, create your first
NPC (with dialogs and a quest!). All of that within a 1 hour or so tutorial.

I used to believe that Unity 3D was super complex (and it can be, for sure haha), but for 2D projects/indie games
it can be very simple and easy to use!

As the interface goes, here's the basic stuff:

## Tiles

In this tutorial, to create new things on your world, you can open go to **Window -> 2D -> Tile Pallete** and all
the sprites for things like floors, walls, fences and water will appear on a window. We can use the "brush tool" to
paint the tiles to the scene.

## Roofs, NPCs & etc

The tutorial provides us with some assets that aren't loaded as sprites. To make use of them, we need to look for them
on the **Project Window**. Then, is just a question of click n' drop them to the **Hiererchy Window**.

By clicking on the assets droped there, we can add **Components** to them. Components will server many functions, such
as conversation, fading objects, colision detection, quests and many more.

I don't think there's need to go into a lot of details on HOW to do it. The UI is pretty self explanatory for theses
things.

## Next Steps

So, after finishing the Creator Kit - RPG, I'll be starting on the [Ruby's Adventure 2D - Beginner](https://learn.unity.com/project/ruby-s-2d-rpg)
project. My goal is to learn everything I can about design, programming and building my own RPGs so that I can create
my online RPG next!
